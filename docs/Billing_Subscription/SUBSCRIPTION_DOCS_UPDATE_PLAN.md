## Status

**Superseded by:** `docs/Billing_Subscription/SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_SECURITY_SSOT.md`

This file is retained as a historical planning artifact. The authoritative security and production-hardening reference for subscription work is now the SSOT document above.

## Why This Plan Was Superseded

The original plan captured useful tasks but split critical security guidance across multiple sections and tactical checklists. The SSOT consolidates architecture, risks, controls, and execution priority into one maintained source.

## Historical Scope Covered by This Plan

- Pricing documentation alignment.
- Billing dashboard documentation updates.
- Subscription implementation status updates.
- API reference and navigation cleanup.

## Current Required Source of Truth

For all new subscription security decisions, implementation planning, and production readiness checks, use:

- `docs/Billing_Subscription/SUBSCRIPTION_SYSTEM_SECURITY_SSOT.md`

## Migration Guidance

When editing older docs that reference this plan:

1. Keep backward links if needed for context.
2. Add explicit pointer to the SSOT.
3. Avoid duplicating security standards outside the SSOT unless unavoidable.

## Archive Note

This document remains in the repository to preserve planning history and rationale, but it should not be used as the primary decision document.
