# Assistive Writing User Guide

## What is Assistive Writing?

Assistive Writing is an AI-powered feature in ALwrity that helps you continue your LinkedIn posts with contextually relevant suggestions. It uses advanced AI to understand what you're writing and provides intelligent continuations based on real-time web research.

## How to Use Assistive Writing

### 1. Enable Assistive Writing

1. Open the LinkedIn Writer in ALwrity
2. Look for the **"Assistive Writing"** toggle switch in the header
3. Click the toggle to enable the feature (it will turn blue when active)

### 2. Start Writing

1. Begin typing your LinkedIn post in the text area
2. Write at least **5 words** to give the AI enough context
3. Wait **5 seconds** after typing - the AI will automatically analyze your content

### 3. Receive Your First Suggestion

- After 5 words and 5 seconds, you'll see an **"Assistive Writing Suggestion"** card appear near your cursor
- The suggestion includes:
  - **Confidence score** (how certain the AI is about the suggestion)
  - **Suggested text** to continue your post
  - **Source links** for verification and further reading

### 4. Accept or Dismiss Suggestions

**To Accept a Suggestion:**
- Click the **"Accept"** button
- The suggested text will be inserted at your cursor position
- You can continue editing from there

**To Dismiss a Suggestion:**
- Click the **"Dismiss"** button
- The suggestion will disappear

### 5. Request More Suggestions

After your first automatic suggestion, the system becomes more conservative to save costs:

- You'll see a **"Continue writing"** prompt: *"ALwrity can contextually continue writing. Click Continue writing."*
- Click **"Continue writing"** to get another AI-powered suggestion
- This manual approach ensures you only get suggestions when you actually want them

## Understanding the Suggestions

### What Makes a Good Suggestion?

- **Contextually relevant** to your topic
- **Professionally written** in LinkedIn style
- **Based on real sources** from the web
- **Confidence score** of 70% or higher

### Source Information

Each suggestion includes:
- **Article titles** from reputable sources
- **Clickable links** to read the full articles
- **Author information** when available
- **Publication dates** for recency

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This:
- Write at least 5 words before expecting suggestions
- Use specific, clear language in your posts
- Review source links to verify information
- Accept suggestions that align with your message
- Use the manual "Continue writing" button for additional suggestions

### ❌ Avoid This:
- Expecting suggestions for very short text (under 5 words)
- Accepting suggestions without reviewing them
- Ignoring source links for fact-checking
- Making rapid changes that might confuse the AI

## Troubleshooting

### "No suggestions appearing"
- **Check:** Have you written at least 5 words?
- **Check:** Have you waited 5 seconds after typing?
- **Check:** Is Assistive Writing enabled (toggle should be blue)?

### "API quota exceeded" error
- This means the daily limit for AI suggestions has been reached
- Wait 24 hours for the quota to reset, or upgrade your plan
- The feature will automatically resume when quota is available

### "No relevant sources found"
- The AI couldn't find good sources for your specific topic
- Try being more specific in your writing
- Consider rephrasing to use more common business terms

### "Search service not configured"
- This is a technical configuration issue
- Contact support for assistance

## Cost and Usage

### How It Works:
- **First suggestion:** Automatic after 5 words + 5 seconds
- **Additional suggestions:** Manual only (click "Continue writing")
- **Daily limit:** 50 suggestions per day on free tier
- **Cost control:** Manual triggering prevents excessive API usage

### Why Manual After First Suggestion?
- Saves costs by not making unnecessary API calls
- Gives you control over when to get suggestions
- Prevents overwhelming you with too many options
- Ensures suggestions are relevant to your current writing

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific
Instead of: "AI is changing business"
Try: "AI is transforming customer service with chatbots and predictive analytics"

### 2. Use Industry Terms
The AI understands business terminology better than casual language

### 3. Write Complete Thoughts
Instead of: "Marketing is"
Try: "Marketing is evolving rapidly with new digital tools"

### 4. Review Sources
Always check the provided source links to ensure accuracy

### 5. Edit as Needed
Accept suggestions as starting points, then edit to match your voice
