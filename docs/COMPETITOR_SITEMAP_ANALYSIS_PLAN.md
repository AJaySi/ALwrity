# Competitor Analysis & Sitemap Analysis Plan for Onboarding Step 4

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 1 of Step 4 onboarding, focusing on competitor analysis using the Exa API and enhanced sitemap analysis. This approach provides comprehensive competitive intelligence while optimizing API usage and costs.

---

## 1. Exa API Integration for Competitor Discovery

### 1.1 Exa API Analysis

Based on the [Exa API documentation](https://docs.exa.ai/reference/find-similar-links), the `findSimilar` endpoint is perfectly suited for competitor discovery:

#### Key Features for Competitor Analysis
- **Neural Search**: Uses AI to find semantically similar content (up to 100 results)
- **Content Analysis**: Provides summaries, highlights, and full text
- **Domain Filtering**: Can include/exclude specific domains
- **Date Filtering**: Filter by published/crawl dates
- **Cost Effective**: $0.005 for 1-25 results, $0.025 for 26-100 results

#### Optimal API Configuration for Competitor Discovery
```json
{
  "url": "https://user-website.com",
  "numResults": 25,
  "contents": {
    "text": true,
    "summary": {
      "query": "Business model, target audience, content strategy"
    },
    "highlights": {
      "numSentences": 2,
      "highlightsPerUrl": 3,
      "query": "Unique value proposition, competitive advantages"
    }
  },
  "context": true,
  "moderation": true
}
```

### 1.2 Competitor Discovery Strategy

#### Phase 1: Initial Competitor Discovery
```python
async def discover_competitors(user_url: str, industry: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Discover competitors using Exa API findSimilar endpoint
    """
    # Primary competitor search
    primary_competitors = await exa.find_similar_and_contents(
        url=user_url,
        num_results=15,
        contents={
            "text": True,
            "summary": {
                "query": f"Business model, target audience, content strategy in {industry or 'this industry'}"
            },
            "highlights": {
                "numSentences": 2,
                "highlightsPerUrl": 3,
                "query": "Unique value proposition, competitive advantages, market position"
            }
        },
        context=True,
        moderation=True
    )
    
    # Enhanced competitor search with domain filtering
    enhanced_competitors = await exa.find_similar_and_contents(
        url=user_url,
        num_results=10,
        exclude_domains=[extract_domain(user_url)],  # Exclude user's domain
        contents={
            "text": True,
            "summary": {
                "query": "Content strategy, SEO approach, marketing tactics"
            }
        }
    )
    
    return {
        "primary_competitors": primary_competitors,
        "enhanced_competitors": enhanced_competitors,
        "total_competitors": len(primary_competitors.results) + len(enhanced_competitors.results)
    }
```

#### Phase 2: Competitor Analysis Enhancement
```python
async def analyze_competitor_content(competitor_urls: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Deep dive analysis of discovered competitors
    """
    competitor_analyses = []
    
    for competitor_url in competitor_urls[:10]:  # Limit to top 10 competitors
        # Get competitor's sitemap for structure analysis
        sitemap_analysis = await analyze_sitemap(f"{competitor_url}/sitemap.xml")
        
        # Get competitor's content strategy insights
        content_analysis = await exa.find_similar_and_contents(
            url=competitor_url,
            num_results=5,
            contents={
                "text": True,
                "summary": {
                    "query": "Content strategy, target keywords, audience engagement"
                }
            }
        )
        
        competitor_analyses.append({
            "url": competitor_url,
            "sitemap_analysis": sitemap_analysis,
            "content_insights": content_analysis,
            "competitive_score": calculate_competitive_score(sitemap_analysis, content_analysis)
        })
    
    return competitor_analyses
```

## 2. Enhanced Sitemap Analysis Integration

### 2.1 Current Sitemap Service Enhancement

The existing `SitemapService` will be enhanced to support competitive benchmarking:

#### Enhanced Sitemap Analysis with Competitive Context
```python
async def analyze_sitemap_with_competitive_context(
    user_sitemap_url: str,
    competitor_data: Dict[str, Any],
    industry: str = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Enhanced sitemap analysis with competitive benchmarking
    """
    # Get user's sitemap analysis
    user_analysis = await sitemap_service.analyze_sitemap(
        user_sitemap_url,
        analyze_content_trends=True,
        analyze_publishing_patterns=True
    )
    
    # Extract competitive benchmarks
    competitor_benchmarks = extract_competitive_benchmarks(competitor_data)
    
    # Generate AI insights with competitive context
    competitive_insights = await generate_competitive_sitemap_insights(
        user_analysis, competitor_benchmarks, industry
    )
    
    return {
        "user_sitemap_analysis": user_analysis,
        "competitive_benchmarks": competitor_benchmarks,
        "competitive_insights": competitive_insights,
        "market_positioning": calculate_market_positioning(user_analysis, competitor_benchmarks)
    }
```

### 2.2 Competitive Benchmarking Metrics

#### Key Metrics for Competitive Analysis
```json
{
  "competitive_benchmarks": {
    "content_volume": {
      "user_total_urls": 1250,
      "competitor_average": 2100,
      "market_leader": 4500,
      "user_position": "below_average",
      "opportunity_score": 75
    },
    "publishing_velocity": {
      "user_velocity": 2.5,
