# Product Marketing Suite: Detailed Feature Plan

**Last Updated**: January 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Vision**: Professional product asset creation for e-commerce and product marketing

---

## Executive Summary

The **Product Marketing Suite** is a specialized module focused on creating professional marketing assets specifically ABOUT products. Unlike the Campaign Creator (which orchestrates multi-channel campaigns), this suite enables users to create product images, animations, and voice-overs that showcase their products professionally.

**Key Differentiator**: Product Marketing Suite is PRODUCT-FOCUSED, not campaign-focused. It's about making products look great, move beautifully, and sound professional.
