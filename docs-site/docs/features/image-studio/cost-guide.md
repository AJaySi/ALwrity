## Cost Estimation

### Pre-Flight Validation

Before any operation, Image Studio shows:
- **Estimated Cost**: Credits required
- **Subscription Check**: Validates your tier
- **Credit Balance**: Shows available credits
- **Cost Breakdown**: Detailed cost information

### Estimation Accuracy

- **Create Studio**: Very accurate (known provider costs)
- **Edit Studio**: Accurate (operation-based costs)
- **Upscale Studio**: Accurate (mode-based costs)
- **Batch Operations**: Cost = base × quantity

### Viewing Estimates

1. **Before Generation**: Cost shown in Create Studio
2. **Before Editing**: Cost shown in Edit Studio
3. **Before Upscaling**: Cost shown in Upscale Studio
4. **Operation Button**: Shows cost estimate

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### For Create Studio

1. **Use Draft for Testing**: Test concepts with low-cost Draft quality
2. **Batch Efficiently**: Generate multiple variations in one request
3. **Choose Appropriate Quality**: Don't use Premium for quick previews
4. **Use Templates**: Templates optimize for cost-effectiveness
5. **Provider Selection**: Use cost-effective providers when appropriate

### For Edit Studio

1. **Edit Strategically**: Only edit when necessary
2. **Combine Operations**: Plan edits to minimize operations
3. **Use Masks Efficiently**: Precise masks reduce need for re-editing
4. **Test First**: Use low-cost operations for testing

### For Upscale Studio

1. **Upscale Selectively**: Only upscale best images
2. **Use Fast Mode**: Fast mode for quick previews
3. **Choose Mode Wisely**: Don't use Creative if Conservative is sufficient
4. **Batch Upscaling**: Process multiple images efficiently

### General Strategies

1. **Plan Ahead**: Estimate costs before starting
2. **Iterate Efficiently**: Test with low-cost options first
3. **Reuse Assets**: Don't regenerate similar content
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track costs in Asset Library
5. **Optimize Workflows**: Use efficient workflow patterns

## Cost Examples

### Example 1: Social Media Campaign

**Scenario**: Create 5 images for Instagram, edit 3, optimize for 3 platforms

**Costs**:
- Create 5 images (Standard): 5 × 4 = 20 credits
- Edit 3 images (Remove Background): 3 × 3 = 9 credits
- Social Optimizer: 0 credits (included)
- **Total**: 29 credits

### Example 2: Blog Featured Image

**Scenario**: Create featured image, upscale, optimize for social

**Costs**:
- Create 1 image (Premium): 6 credits
- Upscale (Conservative): 6 credits
- Social Optimizer: 0 credits (included)
- **Total**: 12 credits

### Example 3: Product Photography

**Scenario**: Create product image, remove background, create 3 color variations

**Costs**:
- Create 1 image (Premium): 6 credits
- Remove Background: 3 credits
- Search & Recolor (3 variations): 3 × 4 = 12 credits
- **Total**: 21 credits

### Example 4: Content Library

**Scenario**: Generate 20 images (Draft), edit 10 favorites, upscale 5 best

**Costs**:
- Create 20 images (Draft): 20 × 2 = 40 credits
- Edit 10 images (various): 10 × 4 = 40 credits
- Upscale 5 images (Fast): 5 × 2 = 10 credits
- **Total**: 90 credits
